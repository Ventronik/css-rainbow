# CSS Rainbow

## Goal
A pedagogical exercise to test my css skills. 

## Motivations
Since I haven't done any css in a few months I decided to try and do a simple exercise I thought up. 

## Results
Overall it took me about 30 minutes, with a lot of that time was spent on getting the  margins and arches looking right.

## Lessons Learned and Further development
- the first take away was that I forget the order of values in css margins, borders, and padding
    - For margin and padding it is Top, Right, Bottom, and Left - like a clock
    - For border (and border radius) it is Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Right, and Bottom Left   
- I used chatGPT to make the HTML boiler plate which is way better than me trying to do it from memory.
- One thing I don't like is the nested divs, I will try to fix it when I decide to add to this.
